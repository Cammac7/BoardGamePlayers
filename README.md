Python Programs to solve different boardgames

This collection of programs is from different homework assignments of an AI class in college, discovered years later. Likely most of the code were already included as part of the assignment.
Putting them here because it would be fun to grow the folder and solve other games. Beating Settlers of Catan, for example, would be a lot of fun.
